Streak and difficulty
Visible streak bar near the header: current streak, longest streak, and a tiny “don’t break the chain” message when you’re close to a milestone.
input & accessibility
Quick shortcuts: G to focus guess, H to reveal next hint, 1/2/3 to switch mode (identity/crop/quote), N for next puzzle when solved.
Colorblind‑safe hints: keep your arrows/indicators but back them with text labels and icons so the meaning is clear without color.
