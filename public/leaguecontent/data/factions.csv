zaun,Zaun,"Zaun is a large, undercity district, lying in the deep canyons and valleys threading Piltover. What light reaches below is filtered through fumes leaking from the tangles of corroded pipework and reflected from the stained glass of its industrial architecture. Zaun and Piltover were once united, but are now separate, yet symbiotic societies. Though it exists in perpetual smogged twilight, Zaun thrives, its people vibrant and its culture rich. Piltover’s wealth has allowed Zaun to develop in tandem; a dark mirror of the city above. Many of the goods coming to Piltover find their way into Zaun’s black markets, and hextech inventors who find the restrictions placed upon them in the city above too restrictive often find their dangerous researches welcomed in Zaun. Unfettered development of volatile technologies and reckless industry has rendered whole swathes of Zaun polluted and dangerous. Streams of toxic runoff stagnate in the city’s lower reaches, but even here people find a way to exist and prosper.",images/factions/zaun.jpg,https://cmsassets.rgpub.io/sanity/images/dsfx7636/universe/56d6fa8581379d60cc17951edbe3d686e52bf51b-1730x1080.jpg
void,The Void,"Screaming into existence with the birth of the universe, the Void is a manifestation of the unknowable nothingness that lies beyond. It is a force of insatiable hunger, waiting through the eons until its masters, the mysterious Watchers, mark the final time of undoing.",images/factions/void.jpg,https://cmsassets.rgpub.io/sanity/images/dsfx7636/universe/7107e5dbca7887931748e7ae0924e6eda17ef6f4-1920x1064.jpg
ixtal,Ixtal,"Renowned for its mastery of elemental magic, Ixtal was one of the first independent nations to join the Shuriman empire. In truth, Ixtali culture is much older—part of the great westward diaspora that gave rise to civilizations including the Buhru, magnificent Helia, and the ascetics of Targon—and it is likely they played a significant role in the creation of the first Ascended.",images/factions/ixtal.jpg,https://cmsassets.rgpub.io/sanity/images/dsfx7636/universe/1a75d072fa01ec3d0cda3f87fc1bf18dce736424-5000x2811.jpg
piltover,Piltover,"Piltover is a thriving, progressive city whose power and influence is on the rise. It is Valoran’s cultural center, where art, craftsmanship, trade and innovation walk hand in hand. Its power comes not through military might, but the engines of commerce and forward thinking. Situated on the cliffs above the district of Zaun and overlooking the ocean, fleets of ships pass through its titanic sea-gates, bringing goods from all over the world. The wealth this generates has given rise to an unprecedented boom in the city’s growth. Piltover has - and still is - reinventing itself as a city where fortunes can be made and dreams can be lived. Burgeoning merchant clans fund development in the most incredible endeavors: grand artistic follies, esoteric hextech research, and architectural monuments to their power. With ever more inventors delving into the emergent lore of hextech, Piltover has become a lodestone for the most skilled craftsmen the world over.",images/factions/piltover.jpg,https://cmsassets.rgpub.io/sanity/images/dsfx7636/universe/6c77423961def6e3a82d9a36545782f1a06386e0-4681x2114.jpg
shadow-isles,Shadow Isles,"This cursed land was once home to a noble, enlightened civilization, known to its allies and emissaries as the Blessed Isles. However, more than a thousand years ago, an unprecedented magical cataclysm left the barrier between the material and spirit realms in tatters, effectively merging the two… and dooming all living things in an instant.",images/factions/shadow-isles.jpg,https://cmsassets.rgpub.io/sanity/images/dsfx7636/universe/94e4bf2e1b30ba553b4fc0f93e94983837082210-2503x1080.jpg
bandle-city,Bandle City,"Opinions differ as to where exactly the home of the yordles is to be found, though a handful of mortals claim to have traveled unseen pathways to a land of curious enchantment beyond the material realm. They tell of a place of unfettered magic, where the foolhardy can be led astray by myriad wonders, and end up lost in a dream...",images/factions/bandle-city.jpg,https://cmsassets.rgpub.io/sanity/images/dsfx7636/universe/109f1c35b08e87598eaa1e0755a992e17d9425c2-1920x1080.jpg
shurima,Shurima,"The empire of Shurima was once a thriving civilization that spanned an entire continent. Forged in a bygone age by the mighty god-warriors of the Ascended Host, it united all the disparate peoples of the south, and enforced a lasting peace between them.",images/factions/shurima.jpg,https://cmsassets.rgpub.io/sanity/images/dsfx7636/universe/3f24f923ba9871dd870c0d3565075ff8140f44b8-1920x1080.jpg
mount-targon,Targon,"Mount Targon is the mightiest peak in Runeterra, a towering peak of sun-baked rock amid a range of summits unmatched in scale anywhere else in the world. Located far from civilization, Mount Targon is utterly remote and all but impossible to reach save by the most determined seeker. Many legends cling to Mount Targon, and, like any place of myth, it is a beacon to dreamers, madmen and questors of adventure. Some of these brave souls attempt to scale the impossible mountain, perhaps seeking wisdom or enlightenment, perhaps chasing glory or some soul-deep yearning to witness its summit. The ascent is all but impossible, and those hardy few who somehow survive to reach the top almost never speak of what they have seen. Some return with a haunted, empty look in their eyes, others changed beyond all recognition, imbued by an Aspect of unearthly, inhuman power with a destiny few mortals can comprehend.",images/factions/mount-targon.jpg,https://cmsassets.rgpub.io/sanity/images/dsfx7636/universe/8ad3cfba4b5d7cb812562108a6e90d07e0865b3f-1920x1041.jpg
demacia,Demacia,"A strong, lawful kingdom with a prestigious military history, Demacia’s people have always valued the ideals of justice, honor, and duty most highly, and are fiercely proud of their cultural heritage. But in spite of these lofty principles, this largely self-sufficient nation has grown more insular and isolationist in recent centuries.",images/factions/demacia.jpg,https://cmsassets.rgpub.io/sanity/images/dsfx7636/universe/5b80fe8ddd3d935c3f258f3e145b8aed4b7460bf-1920x887.jpg
bilgewater,Bilgewater,"Nestled away in the Blue Flame Isles archipelago, Bilgewater is a port city like no other—home to serpent hunters, dock gangs, and smugglers from across the known world. Here, fortunes are made and ambitions shattered in the blink of an eye. For those fleeing justice, debt, or persecution, Bilgewater can be a place of new beginnings, for no one on these twisted streets cares about your past. Even so, with each new dawn, careless travelers can always be found floating in the harbor, their purses empty and their throats slit…",images/factions/bilgewater.jpg,https://cmsassets.rgpub.io/sanity/images/dsfx7636/universe/9700d7bf76ec15c8c526f7fea2a960e3846e44a6-2825x1080.jpg
noxus,Noxus,"Noxus is a powerful empire with a fearsome reputation. To those beyond its borders, it is brutal, expansionist, and threatening, yet those who look past its warlike exterior see an unusually inclusive society, where the strengths and talents of its people are respected and cultivated.",images/factions/noxus.jpg,https://cmsassets.rgpub.io/sanity/images/dsfx7636/universe/6310fe5db818f80b84ee784a746cc28ee1273e6b-1920x1080.jpg

ionia,Ionia,"Surrounded by treacherous seas, Ionia is composed of a number of allied provinces scattered across a massive archipelago, known to many as the First Lands. Since Ionian culture has long been shaped by the pursuit of balance in all things, the border between the material and spirit realms tends to be more permeable here, especially in the wild forests and mountains.",images/factions/ionia.jpg,https://cmsassets.rgpub.io/sanity/images/dsfx7636/universe/1691574092da433ea3a4c896c96f8c87d5f7e45a-1920x888.jpg
