Power is given by `x * 40 / 63 + 30`.  `x` is obtained by arranging bit 1 from the IV for each of Special Defense, Special Attack, Speed, Defense, Attack, and HP in that order.  (Bit 1 is 1 if the IV is of the form `4n + 2` or `4n + 3`.  `x` is then 64 * Special Defense IV bit 1, plus 32 * Special Attack IV bit 1, etc.)

Type is given by `y * 15 / 63`, where `y` is similar to `x` above, except constructed from bit 0.  (Bit 0 is 1 if the IV is odd.)  The result is looked up in the following table.

Value | Type
